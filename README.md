## My process

### Built with

- Simple Html
- CSS simple
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned about (and I need to understand more about it), <hr> tag for to create a simple line, to make a hover above image as a lit trick to me I used the background and another layer to do this

```html
<div class="layer" style="background-color: var(--cyan);"></div>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  object-fit: cover;
  position: absolute;
}
```

### Continued development

Like I said before I need to understand more about HR and how to use background-image with URL and hot to make a simple hover without maybe to many DIV

### Useful resources
